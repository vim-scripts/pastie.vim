This script lets you read and create pastes at http://pastie.org/ .  Pastes can be created from a range, a register (including the clipboard), any number of files, all open windows, or an existing paste.  It automatically maps between Vim filetypes and pastie's parsers.  Details for how to use the :Pastie command are included in the comments at the top of the plugin.

Pastie is the preferred method of sharing code in the Ruby IRC community.
